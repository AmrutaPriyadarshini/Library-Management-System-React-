Library Management System (React)
This project is a web-based Library Management System. The frontend is fully developed using React, while the backend is planned to be built with Node.js, Nest.js, and Prisma. Currently, only the frontend is completed.

Internship Context
This project was developed during a Full Stack Internship. Due to limited time, the backend could not be completed. I have previously built a fully working Library Management System using .NET Framework WebForms (C#), and with more time I can complete this project using the planned stack.

Future Enhancements
Activity logs
Analytics and reporting
Fine calculation module
Email/SMS reminders

Conclusion
The project demonstrates strong understanding of React, component-based UI development, and planning for a full stack application. The frontend is fully ready to be integrated with the backend when developed.
